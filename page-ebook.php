            &lt;&lt;This is a book that sales compensation plan designers will certainly use
        over and over. While the cases and examples reflect practices in Latin America, the
        concepts, principles and processes it provides transcends geographies and cultures.
        It is a valuable contribution to the sales compensation body of knowledge&gt;&gt;

            &lt;&lt;A robust and continous revenue growth is paramount to the success and
        financial valuation of an enterprise. A well motivated and compensated sales force is
        an important step towards this objective. Federico Lopez' book, Sales Compensation
        presents detailed information on several and different methods to compensate sales
        forces that any CEO or entrepeneur should carefully study&gt;&gt;

            &lt;&lt;Mr. Lopez' book provides a context and framework for the field of sales
        compensation that few others have been able to do so clearly. His philosophy to
        design, implement and measure incentive plans shines a new light on this topic and
        should be reviewed by any enterprise compensation team looking to make an
        impact&gt;&gt;
